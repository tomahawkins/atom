-- This is a brief tutorial of Atom's new syntax.
-- A lot of the syntax is inspired by Haskell.

-- Comments look like this.
{- And like this. -}
{- Comments can be {- nested -} . -}

-- Named values have a type and value in one line:
someBoolean :: Bool = true;

-- The type is optional:
anotherBoolean = false;

-- If a function has a type signature, the arguments follow the type signature after the pipe separator:
doSomething :: Int -> Int -> Int | a b = undefined;

-- If a function has no type signature, no pipe separator needed.  Function calls are similar to Haskell's:
doTheSame a b = doSomething a b;

-- Infix operators should defined associativity and precedence (default is infixl 9):
infixl 6 +

-- Infix operators use the (op) convention when in variable position:
(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int | a b = add a b;

-- Lambda expressions.  Note the '=' instead of '->':
add :: Int -> Int -> Int = \ a b = a + b;

-- Recursive let (where) bindings.
something :: Int -> Bool | arg = c
  where
  a :: Bool = false;
  b :: Bool = true;
  c :: Bool = a && b;
  ;

-- Datatype definitions:
datatype Something param1 param2 = constructor1 | constructor2 param1 | constructor3 param2 Bool;

-- Case (pattern matching) expressions:
match :: Something -> SomethingElse | a = case a of
  contructor1      = ();
  constructor2 a   = ();
  c@(constructor3 a b)
    | guard1       = ()
    | guard2       = ()
    | otherwise    = (); 
  _                = ();
  ;
